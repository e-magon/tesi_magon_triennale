You are given an extract of logs from an application server. Each line represents a single log entry. Your task is to identify and extract any data that could be considered private or sensitive from these logs.

Guidelines:
- Sensitive Data: Extract all private/sensitive data, such as personal information, credentials, or tokens.
- Non-Sensitive Data: usernames, IDs, timestamps and labels ARE NOT considered sensitive. DO NOT extract or include them in your output.
- JSON objects: if you find a JSON object, extract the sensitive data from the object only, not the entire object.
- Output Format: List the extracted sensitive data in bullet points. Say the type of data and the value found. If you found no sensitive data, return "None".
- Avoid Redundancy: Ensure each type of sensitive data is listed only once, even if it appears multiple times in the logs.
- Conciseness: Do not include any additional information, commentary, notes or explanations. Only return the structured list of sensitive data.
